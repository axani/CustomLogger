## Dependencies
* I assume you work on a Mac (although everything should work just fine on other systems, with the usual fiddling.) and have Python with Virtualenv installed.
* Git

## How to
* Run ". start_project.sh" in your terminal and follow the script. This downloads all dependencies and creates, and activates a virtualenv with Django for you.
